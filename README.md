I wrote this in 2014 when I was following the Microsoft Accelerator Program.  
It is a mobile and desktop app, very simple! Hence the name! I have not made a microsoft
App since then, so this is illustrative of my ability to pick up how to make an app in that
environment (I would definitely have to relearn this if I needed to do it again, but it is usually
much easier to relearn than the initial learning!).  It also illustrates my ability to produce 
product capable of passing external product review.
